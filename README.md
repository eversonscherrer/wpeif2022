# Article objective
This article exposes how to install freerouter and execute a core topology with Segment Routing.

- Operating system supported:
  - Debian 10 (stable aka buster)
  - Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic beaver)
  - Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal fossa)


# Freertr
Freertr is a control plane: Router OS process speaks various network protocols, (re)encap packets, and exports forwarding tables to hardware switches. Basically, it is only necessary to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Below is demonstrated how to install it on operating systems: Linux, Windows and macOS.

## Install JRE
### Linux
For demonstration purposes, the Debian-based Linux installation was chosen.
```console
#sudo apt-get install default-jre-headless --no-install-recommends
```

### MacOS
```console
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
sdk list java
sdk install java 17.0.2-open
sdk default java 17.0.2-open
java -version
```

### Windows
In order to install the Windows version of Java, you need to visit the official Java website and download the Windows executable. After the download, check if your user has permission to install and perform the installation through the graphical environment. 

## Install Freertr
The freeRouter homepage is at freertr.net. Starting from this page, you'll find various resources such as source code (there is also a GitHub mirror), binaries, and other images that might be of your interest. From there we just download the freeRouter jar files.

```console
#wget freertr.net/rtr.jar
````

# Launch the Topology
Now it's time to run the topology, to run it, download all the hardware and software files that are in the repository, in the same folder.

**NOTE**
> To orchestrate the execution of the topology we use ```tmux```, if you don't have it installed, remember to install it.
```console
sudo apte-get install tmux
or
brew install tmux
````
