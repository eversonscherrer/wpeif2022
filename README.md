# Paper Title

A lifecycle experience of PolKA: From prototyping to deployment at GÃ©ant Lab with RARE/FreeRouter

# Requirement

Basic Linux/Unix knowledge
Service provider networking knowledge

# Topology
The paper used this diagram to describe a PolKA demo scenario.

# Operating system supported
This point exposes how to install freerouter and execute a edge-core topology with PolKA.

- Debian 10 (stable aka buster)
- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic beaver)
- Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal fossa)


# Freertr
Freertr is a control plane: Router OS process speaks various network protocols, (re)encap packets, and exports forwarding tables to hardware switches. Basically, it is only necessary to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Below is demonstrated how to install it on operating systems: Linux, Windows and macOS.

## Install JRE
### Linux
For demonstration purposes, the Debian-based Linux installation was chosen.
```console
#sudo apt-get install default-jre-headless --no-install-recommends
```

### MacOS
```console
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
sdk list java
sdk install java 17.0.2-open
sdk default java 17.0.2-open
java -version
```

### Windows
In order to install the Windows version of Java, you need to visit the official Java website and download the Windows executable. After the download, check if your user has permission to install and perform the installation through the graphical environment. 

## Install Freertr
The freeRouter homepage is at freertr.net. Starting from this page, you'll find various resources such as source code (there is also a GitHub mirror), binaries, and other images that might be of your interest. From there we just download the freeRouter jar files.


```console
#wget freertr.net/rtr.jar
````

# Launch the Topology
Now it's time to run the topology, to run it, download all the hardware and software files that are in the repository, in the same folder.

**NOTE**
> To orchestrate the execution of the topology we use ```tmux```, if you don't have it installed, remember to install it.
```console
sudo apte-get install tmux
or
brew install tmux
````
There is a file called ```start-topology.sh``` in the repository. This file orchestrates the execution of all routers in a single run.

```console
#chmod +x start-topology.sh
#./start-topology.sh
```

# PolKA Experimentation

## 1 - To access the router, just access via telnet or ssh, in our demo, we use telnet.

```telnet <localhost> <port>```

For example, Access Router R5, to access another router, just change the port.
```console
telnet 127.0.0.1 2525
```

## 2 - Check running-config for PolKA tunnel1.

```console
show running-config interface tunnel1
```

````
R5#show running-config interface tunnel1
interface tunnel1
 description POLKA tunnel shortest ipv4 from R5 -> R6
 tunnel vrf v1
 tunnel source loopback0
 tunnel destination 20.20.20.6
 tunnel domain-name 20.20.20.1 20.20.20.2
 tunnel mode polka
 vrf forwarding v1
 ipv4 address 30.30.30.1 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown
 no log-link-change
 exit
!
````

## 3 - Check running-config for PolKA tunnel4.

```console
show running-config interface tunnel4
```
````
R5#show running-config interface tunnel4
interface tunnel4
 description POLKA tunnel longues ipv6 from R5 -> R6
 tunnel vrf v1
 tunnel source loopback0
 tunnel destination 2020::6
 tunnel domain-name 2020::1 2020::4 2020::3 2020::2
 tunnel mode polka
 vrf forwarding v1
 ipv6 address 4040::1 ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::
 no shutdown
 no log-link-change
 exit
!
````


## 4 - Check if the tunnels it's work, just use the command below. If the tunnels and interfaces is working, after insert the command you see "up".
```console
show interface summary
```

```
R5#show interfaces summary
interface  state  tx       rx      drop
template1  admin  667      0       64014
loopback0  up     286756   0       0
ethernet1  up     1035022  951379  0
ethernet2  up     652494   456591  0
tunnel1    up     0        0       0
tunnel2    up     0        0       0
tunnel3    up     26910    0       0
tunnel4    up     407684   0       230
```

## 5 - Check the routeID and parameters from PolKA Tunnels 1 and 4. In this point its intersting to notice that 

Details from Tunnel 1

```console
show polka routeid tunnel1
```

```
R5#show polka routeid tunnel1
